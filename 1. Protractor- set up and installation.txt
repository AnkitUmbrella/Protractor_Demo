Protractor is an end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS applications. Protractor runs tests against 
your application running in a real browser,
interacting with it as a user would.



1. (Nodejs download and setup)- https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Use npm to install Protractor globally with:
Install node js.

npm Version-> npm -v -->> 6.4.1
npm Update-> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18412129/how-can-i-update-npm-on-windows
Protractor is a Node.js program. To run, you will need to have Node.js installed. 
You will download Protractor package using npm, which comes with Node.js. Check the version of Node.js you have
by running node --version or node -v ->> v10.15.3



2. (Install Protractor)
npm install -g protractor
This will install two command line tools, protractor and webdriver-manager.
Try running protractor --version --> Version 5.3.2 to make sure it's working.

The webdriver-manager is a helper tool to easily get an instance of a Selenium Server running. 
Use it to download the necessary binaries with:

webdriver-manager update
Now start up a server with:

webdriver-manager start
This will start up a Selenium Server and will output a bunch of info logs. Your Protractor test will send requests to this server to control a local browser. You can see information about the status of the server at http://localhost:4444/wd/hub.
